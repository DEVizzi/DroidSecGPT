1. Vulnerability Type: Android_SystemLoadLibrary, Android_DynamicCode_Loading
Total Occurrences: 1

Example 1:
File: java_code\sources\jakhar\aseem\diva\DivaJni.java
Code Snippet:
```
package jakhar.aseem.diva;
/* loaded from: classes.dex */
public class DivaJni {
    private static final String soName = "divajni";

    public native int access(String str);

    public native int initiateLaunchSequence(String str);

    static {
        System.loadLibrary(soName);
    }
}

```
Vulnerability: Name:** Native Code Injection Vulnerability (via Dynamic Library Loading)
Severity: ** High
Description: **

The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability stemming from the use of `System.loadLibrary()`. This function dynamically loads a native shared library (.so file) at runtime.  The `soName` variable ("divajni" in this case) directly specifies the name of the library to load.  This presents a significant security risk because:

1. **Unvalidated Input:** The library name is hardcoded.  An attacker could potentially replace the legitimate "divajni.so" library with a malicious one containing arbitrary code.  If the application is compromised, the attacker could potentially substitute the library through techniques such as exploiting other vulnerabilities within the application, modifying the application's APK, or manipulating the file system on a rooted device.

2. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious `.so` file could contain arbitrary native code that executes with the privileges of the application. This could lead to various attacks, including data theft, privilege escalation, and complete device compromise. The attacker's code would run within the application's process, potentially gaining access to sensitive data handled by the application or other system resources.

3. **Lack of Integrity Checks:** There's no verification mechanism in place to ensure the integrity of the loaded library.  The code simply trusts that the library named "divajni.so" is the legitimate one.


**Mitigation Strategy:**

Several strategies can significantly mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Code Signing and Verification:**  Implement a robust mechanism to verify the digital signature of the native library before loading it.  This ensures that the library originates from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with.  This often involves using a keystore and verifying the signature against a known, trusted key.

2. **Hashing and Comparison:** Before loading the library, calculate its cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) and compare it against a known good hash stored securely within the application.  Any mismatch indicates tampering.  This hash should be embedded in the application's resources, perhaps encrypted.

3. **Restrict Library Location:** Instead of relying on the system's default library search paths, explicitly specify the path to the native library. This limits the ability of an attacker to substitute a malicious library from a different location.  This path should be within the application's private directory.

4. **Secure Storage of Native Libraries:**  Store the native libraries in a secure location, such as the application's private directory, and ensure that only the application has access to it. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized modification.

5. **Minimize Native Code:** If possible, reduce or eliminate the reliance on native code.  Consider using Java or Kotlin alternatives whenever feasible. This reduces the attack surface significantly.

6. **Runtime Integrity Monitoring:** Use a mobile application security testing (MAST) solution that monitors application behavior at runtime.  These tools can detect suspicious behavior, including the loading of unexpected native libraries, and alert security personnel.

7. **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the application and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches to address any known vulnerabilities.

Implementing a combination of these strategies will drastically reduce the risk associated with dynamic native library loading.  Relying on only one of these methods is insufficient to guarantee robust security.
